# Swinburne_COS20001_Feb18_Assignment
This repository contains the source code for the group assignment by group 3 of tutorial group 1 of Swinburne Sarawak's COS20001 User Centered Design Assignment

The Assignment was about designing a user centered UI but we decided to take it to the next level.

The project is a webpage for a service for planning parties.
The frontend is written in HTML and CSS. The authors also used CSS files from W3Schools for most of the UI elements.
The backend is written in Javascript and PHP.

The webpage is ran on an Apache webserver provided by the XAMPP suite on a Linux server. 

As the code was only used by the author for their assignment, a page is also created to allow the author(s) to push their code changes from the github repository to the actual webserver. This page and its respective function will only work on a Linux system.
